ukanrens are cool. Trying in rust after a python sketch, from: http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf .

A few things to try from [The Reasoned Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262535519/)

Doesn't seem totally complete but better than I thought. So alright for a work in progress.
